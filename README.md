<h1>Interactive Video-Based Training Agent</h1>
<h2>Agent Description</h2>
The Interactive Video-Based Training Agent is an AI-powered system that uses natural language processing and computer vision technologies to facilitate interactive learning. It provides learners with the ability to ask questions during training sessions, and it responds by offering answers derived from the training material and video content.

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
Traditional training methods, whether in-person or online, often lack real-time interactivity. Learners frequently encounter difficulties in understanding or interpreting specific parts of the training material. The inability to ask questions directly or clarify doubts during a video training session results in reduced engagement, slower learning, and incomplete understanding of the subject matter.
<h2>Solution Statement</h2>
The Interactive Video-Based Training Agent enables real-time question-and-answer capabilities by analyzing and indexing training materials, including video content and accompanying documents. The agent can:
<li>Detect and understand questions posed by learners.</li>
<li>Retrieve relevant information from the indexed content.</li>
<li>Provide precise, contextually appropriate answers in real time. This promotes a more dynamic and effective learning experience.</li>

<h2>POC Deliverables</h2>
A functioning training agent demonstrating real-time question-answering capabilities, including timestamp-based navigation to relevant video segments and content retrieval from accompanying documents. User interfaces for learners to interact with the agent using text or voice inputs.
<h2>Expected Benefits</h2>
<li>90% reduction in learner’s time spent searching for answers.</li>
<li>85% improvement in learner engagement during training sessions.</li>
<li>75% enhancement in knowledge retention through interactive and contextual learning.</li>
<li>80% better alignment of training content with learner queries.</li>
<li>70% reduction in the need for manual trainer interventions.</li>
<li>95% compliance with delivering relevant content in response to learner queries.</li>
<h2>Sample Data Requirements</h2>
<li>Training videos with clear audio and visual content.</li>
<li>Accompanying documents, such as PDFs, PowerPoints, or text files.</li>
<li>A list of frequently asked questions (FAQs) or sample queries to train the system.</li>
<li>Metadata for the videos, including titles, descriptions, and keywords.</li>
